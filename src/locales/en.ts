      overview:
        "AdlaWatt is a transportable, off-grid solar backup power system designed to provide households with an affordable and reliable source of electricity during power interruptions. The system collects solar energy using a solar panel, stores it in a battery inside a secure lockable enclosure, and supplies backup power to everyday appliances through a built-in AC outlet. Through real-time sensors and a simple mobile application, users can view live battery levels, incoming solar power, energy consumption, and safety temperatures, while receiving smart appliance recommendations based on their remaining battery capacity. By bringing real-time monitoring and energy guidance together, AdlaWatt empowers families to easily control their energy usage, keep essential devices running safely, and maintain power during blackouts.",
