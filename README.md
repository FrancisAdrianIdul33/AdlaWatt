# AdlaWatt

An IoT-based transportable off-grid solar energy harvesting system with a mobile application for real-time energy monitoring, appliance recommendations, notifications, and backup power management during electricity interruptions.

AdlaWatt is designed to provide households with an alternative backup power source by harvesting solar energy, storing it in a battery, and supplying electricity through a built-in AC outlet. The mobile application allows users to monitor battery status, solar energy, power consumption, temperature, system status, energy history, and appliance recommendations.

> **Project Status:** In Development
> The mobile application is integrated with Supabase — authentication, database, Edge Functions, and real-time streaming — for live monitoring, notifications (in-app + email), activity logs, appliances, and analytics report export. Implemented: battery chart rendering (`BatteryLevelChart` via `react-native-gifted-charts`), 5-day solar forecast, branded alert emails via AgentMail, slim appliance catalog (`GIVEN_CATALOG` + `appliancesService`), and persisted theme/typography/email preferences. Still in progress: additional historical charts, notification threshold tuning, and the end-to-end ESP32 hardware feed.

## Overview

AdlaWatt is an IoT-based off-grid solar energy harvesting system developed as a backup power solution for households during electricity interruptions.

The system collects solar energy through a solar panel and stores the generated energy in a 12V battery housed inside a transportable lockable enclosure. A built-in AC outlet allows compatible household appliances to use the stored energy.

The system monitors energy generation, energy consumption, battery status, battery temperature, solar panel temperature, and interior temperature. Sensor data is transmitted through an ESP32 to a cloud database and streamed in real time to the AdlaWatt mobile application.

One of the main features of AdlaWatt is its appliance recommendation system. Users can identify appliances they plan to use, and the application recommends suitable appliances based on their power requirements and the available battery level.

AdlaWatt is intended as a backup power source during electricity interruptions and is not designed to replace the electrical grid.

## Features

### Real-Time Monitoring

The application displays live monitoring information received in real time from Supabase (the ESP32 writes to the `monitoring` table; the app subscribes to `postgres_changes` updates). The dashboard shows:

- Battery percentage and battery status (Charging / Discharging / Idle)
- Battery voltage
- Battery energy in watt-hours and estimated time remaining
- Current appliance load
- Depth of discharge (DoD) status (Safe / Unsafe)
- Incoming solar energy and solar status (Low / Moderate / High)
- Solar voltage, solar current, solar timer, and total energy
- Battery temperature, solar panel temperature, and interior temperature (each with Nominal / Elevated / High / Critical status)
- Device status (Online / Offline)
- Live weather (temperature, description, location) from OpenWeatherMap

A battery gauge with smooth animated transitions and a live weather card are rendered on the dashboard.

### Appliance Recommendation

The application allows users to view or select household appliances and receive recommendations based on the available battery state.

A battery-aware recommendation engine (`src/services/recommendation.ts`) classifies the battery tier (Safe / Caution / Unsafe) using remaining energy, the 144 Wh reserve floor (20% of the 720 Wh ZENOVA 12V 30Ah ×2 nominal, 576 Wh usable), voltage, and depth of discharge, then estimates per-appliance runtime from the usable energy and the appliance power range (`wattage_min`/`wattage_max`). The engine computes the full analysis (tier, usable Wh, charge-scaled wattage cap, voltage headroom, budget share, runtime range, `recommended` / `care` / `notRecommended` verdict, reasons, load-stack checks) while the dashboard and Appliances screens expose the simplified two-badge display:

- **OK to use** — `recommended` or `care` (usable with care)
- **Not advisable** — `notRecommended` (blocked battery, unsafe voltage, over wattage cap, draws > 25%/hr, < 10 minutes runtime, or invalid wattage)

Appliance data comes from the slim `appliances` table (`app_id, appliance_name, type, catalog_key, wattage_min/max, selection, archive, user_id`) resolved through `src/constants/applianceCatalog.ts` (`GIVEN_CATALOG`, `catalog:` namespaced keys, `min-maxW` display) and `src/services/appliancesService.ts`. Catalog wattage/area always come from code, never from DB columns. When no live monitoring reading is available yet, the screens fall back to the previous wattage-threshold rule.

### Dashboard

The dashboard provides a summary of the current AdlaWatt system condition, including:

- Battery status and battery gauge
- Solar input
- Current load
- Device status
- Battery, solar panel, and interior temperatures
- Depth of discharge status
- Appliance recommendations
- Recent activity logs
- Quick navigation buttons with smooth scrolling

### Weather & 5-Day Solar Forecast

The dashboard includes a live weather card that displays the current temperature, condition description, and location using the OpenWeatherMap API. Location is resolved through device permissions (`expo-location`) with balanced accuracy, and weather refreshes automatically every 10 minutes (`autoRefreshMs 600000` in `src/data/weather.json`).

A 5-day solar outlook (`src/services/forecast.ts`) groups OpenWeatherMap `/forecast` 3-hour steps into daily summaries tuned for solar planning: peak condition (most extreme present, not majority vote), solar outlook (High / Moderate / Low), `tempMax`/`tempMin`, `popMax%`, hot/cold flags (`hotC 30` / `coldC 20`), and a best-sun day summary (“Best sun: {day} — good day to charge fully.” / “Low sun all week — conserve battery.”). The Weather Monitoring card (`ChartCard type="weather"`) renders pinned Today plus a horizontal upcoming strip alongside thresholds, icons, and error/skeleton states from `src/services/weatherConfig.ts` + `src/services/weatherForecast.ts`. Forecast loads independently so it never blocks monitoring.

### Notifications (In-App + Email)

The application generates and displays system notifications in real time via transition-gated `check*()` rules in `src/services/notificationService.ts`:

- Battery alerts (charging, discharging, low level, fully charged, runtime, voltage — voltage rules inactive until production thresholds are set: `SAFE_BATTERY_VOLTAGE_MIN/MAX = null`)
- Temperature alerts (battery, solar panel, and interior — Nominal to Critical)
- Solar alerts (input detected, increased, unavailable, low input during charging)
- Load alerts (current load detected, no load, consumption increased — high-load rule inactive until `SAFE_CURRENT_LOAD_THRESHOLD` is configured)
- Depth of discharge alerts (safe, unsafe, returned to safe)
- Device status alerts (online, offline, status changed)
- Data health alerts (stale monitoring, missing records, invalid time remaining)

Notifications are stored in the Supabase `notifications` table, include `normal` or `alert` types, use 10-min / 5-min cooldowns to avoid alert spam, and can be marked as read. An unread-count badge is shown on the navigation bar. Notifications and activity logs are kept as separate lists with a hard boundary (see `implementation plan/notification_catalog.md`); login uses a generic message.

Alert-type notifications also send a branded email via `src/services/alertEmailService.ts` → Supabase Edge Function `send-alert-email` (AgentMail proxy, API key server-only). The email is a Gmail-safe 600px table with inline styles, exact AdlaWatt logo (hosted via `EXPO_PUBLIC_AGENTMAIL_LOGO_URL`, cream/white header), and no CTA. Sends are JWT-gated, fire-and-forget, and cooldown-gated. A global per-user “Email notifications” toggle (default ON, `users.email_notifications`) gates email sends on every device — in-app rows are always written regardless. The toggle persists server-side with a per-user `AsyncStorage` cache (`adlawatt.email_notifications.v1(:userId)`) so it survives offline.

### Activity Logs

The application provides an activity log for viewing recorded system activities and events. Logs are paginated and typed (info, warning, error, critical). The dashboard also provides a preview of recent activity logs with an option to view all recorded activities.

### Appliance Management

Users can view household appliances and their power requirements, select appliances for use, and manage custom appliances backed by the slim `appliances` table and `GIVEN_CATALOG`:

- Add, edit (shared dialog), and delete custom appliances; archive with confirmation (mirrors delete); `archive=true` hides the row
- 3-dot toggle menu (replaces long-press), selection circle, archives button with select-all and archived count, loading + empty states
- Advisable / Caution / Not Advisable status from the recommendation engine (simplified to Advisable / Not Advisable badges in list views)
- Filters by advisability, power rating (All / Highest / Moderate / Low via `levelFromWatts`), and area (Living / Bedroom / Kitchen / Work-Study / Bathroom / Porch / Custom Appliances)
- Display stays `min-maxW` (e.g. `35-75W`) so `parseWattageRange` + validators keep working; `catalog:` keys are never renamed after release

### Component Monitoring

The Components screen provides live status information for the IoT and power components used by the AdlaWatt system (`Buck Converter`, `DS18B20 (Battery/Solar)`, `ESP32`, `INA228 (Input/Output)`, `Relay Module 5V 1 Channel`, `Voltage Sensor`, `DHT22`, `5V DC Fan`, `SPI TFT Display`), retrieved from Supabase with real-time updates and mapped to local images in `assets/images/components/`.

### Analytics & Reports

The Analytics screen loads historical data from the `monitoring_history` and `appliance_usage_history` tables for a selected date range and frequency (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly). It generates:

- **Battery Level Over Time chart** (`AnalyticsChartCard` + `charts/BatteryLevelChart.tsx` via `react-native-gifted-charts` `LineChart`, curved area chart, fixed 0–100 Y axis, dashed red 20% safety floor, theme-aware grid, text legend so the floor never relies on color alone, dark-mode softened fill). Data flows through `groupMonitoringHistory` → `getBatteryChartRangeData` in `src/services/analyticsService.ts` with shared colors/helpers in `src/services/chartMath.ts` (`CHART_HEIGHT 190`, `clampPercent`, `useChartColors`). `AnalyticsChartCard` is a generic wrapper (header + frequency `SlidingToggle` + `{children}`) — currently only the battery chart is wired; additional metrics are future work.
- **PDF reports** (jsPDF + jspdf-autotable) with brand header, embedded AdlaWatt logo, summary statistics, energy summary, monitoring history, appliance usage history, and chart data tables
- **CSV exports** for raw data

Reports use the real jsPDF binary download on web and the native share sheet on mobile (`Share.share` text preparation on native). Chart axes always render, even without enough history (empty → zero points).

### Settings (Menu)

The Menu screen (`SettingsScreen`, staged Save/Cancel draft flow) provides account management and user preferences:

- Edit username and email
- Change password (with current-password verification)
- Dark mode toggle (system / light / dark, instant apply), color-blind mode, font size (Small / Medium / Big, 0.875 / 1 / 1.15 scale), font family (Inter / Roboto / Times New Roman / Monospace / System Default via `expo-font` + `useAppFonts`), language, vibration, and global per-user email-notification preference
- Logout with confirmation

> Persistence: theme (`adlawatt.theme.v2`, with v1 migration), typography (`adlawatt.typography.v1`), and email-notifications (server `users.email_notifications` + per-user `AsyncStorage` cache) survive app restarts and offline. Color-blind mode, language, and vibration are session-only by design. `fontWeight` was removed — old saves carrying it are ignored without migration. A single shared `SettingsProvider` + `ThemeProvider` in `app/dashboard/_layout.tsx` propagates typography/theme to all dashboard screens (auth screens intentionally render light).

### About Us

The About Us section provides information about the AdlaWatt project and its developers.

### Authentication

The application uses Supabase authentication with:

- Registration (username, email, password) with validation and Terms and Conditions; profile row created by DB trigger (with backfill migration), non-dismissable “check-your-email” modal
- Login by username or email (60s resend throttle, mapped error messages)
- Auth callback (`/auth/callback`, `adlawatt://auth/callback` for PKCE on native, `/auth/callback` on web)
- Persistent login sessions (`AuthContext` single source via `getSession` + `onAuthStateChange`; AsyncStorage on native, localStorage on web)
- User profile loading and account updates (username, email, password; `email_notifications` defaults ON)
- Email change handling with confirmation
- Logout functionality (silences expected Realtime `CLOSED`, guards logout writes; `shutdownNotificationService` on sign-out/user change)

> No forgot-password route or screen exists yet.

## System Components

AdlaWatt consists of three major parts:

### 1. Physical Power System

The physical system consists of:

- Solar panel
- Solar charge controller
- 12V battery
- Inverter
- Built-in AC outlet
- Protection components
- Transportable lockable enclosure

### 2. IoT Monitoring System

The IoT system collects and processes information from the physical power system using an ESP32 and connected sensors (INA228 input/output, DS18B20 battery/solar, DHT22 interior, voltage sensor, relay, SPI TFT display). Sensor readings are transmitted to the cloud database over Wi-Fi.

### 3. Software System

The software system consists of:

- Cross-platform mobile application for household users
- Web-based admin dashboard for researchers (planned)
- Supabase cloud database with real-time data streaming
- REST/HTTP communication between the IoT system and cloud services

The capstone identifies the household user and admin as the primary actors. Household users monitor the system through the mobile application, while administrators can monitor data, view historical information, and configure alert thresholds.

PKCE callback handler (`auth/callback.tsx`) for email confirmation and OAuth-style redirects — not a user-facing screen.

---

## Data and Backend

### Current Integration State

The application is connected to Supabase for authentication, database, Edge Functions, Storage, and real-time streaming. Data is scoped to the authenticated user through `user_id` filtering and Supabase Realtime channels. The notification service starts explicitly on sign-in (staggered 600ms after first paint in `dashboard/_layout.tsx` to avoid channel-burst socket 1006) and shuts down on sign-out/user change.

Static/mock dashboard values have been replaced by live Supabase queries and real-time subscriptions.

### Supabase Tables & Storage

| Table / Bucket | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `users` | User profiles (created by database trigger on sign-up + backfill migration; includes `email_notifications` boolean default true) |
| `monitoring` | Current live sensor readings (single row per user) |
| `monitoring_history` | Historical monitoring records for analytics (5-min cron snapshots via `record_all_monitoring_snapshots()`) |
| `appliance_usage_history` | Historical appliance usage for analytics |
| `appliances` | Slim schema: `app_id, appliance_name, type, catalog_key, wattage_min/max, selection, archive, user_id` (`archive=true` = hidden) |
| `notifications` | Generated notifications with read state (separate list from activity logs) |
| `activity_logs` | Recorded system activities via manual `logActivity()` (no triggers/hooks) |
| `components` | IoT/power component list and live status |
| Storage `email-assets` (public) | Hosted alert-email logo/assets |

### Real-Time Features

- **Monitoring**: `postgres_changes` subscription on the `monitoring` table (all events) for the current user
- **Device status**: `UPDATE` subscription dedicated to the device online/offline state
- **Notifications**: automatic alert generation driven by real-time monitoring updates, staleness checks, and auth state changes; alert-type rows also trigger `maybeSendAlertEmail()`
- **Components**: live `componentsChannel` and `monitoringChannel` subscriptions
- **Startup hardening**: stable topics, leak guard/retry, staggered startup, silenced expected `CLOSED`/1006, web touch hardening

### Edge Function: `send-alert-email`

Server-side AgentMail proxy (`supabase/functions/send-alert-email/index.ts`). The AgentMail API key lives only as a Supabase secret — never in the app bundle. Calls are JWT-gated (`supabase.functions.invoke` with caller token).

```bash
supabase secrets set AGENTMAIL_API_KEY=<agentmail-key>
# optional, defaults to adlawatt@agentmail.to
supabase secrets set AGENTMAIL_SENDER_INBOX=<sender-inbox>
supabase functions deploy send-alert-email
```

### Environment Variables

The app reads its configuration from local environment files (`.env.local`, gitignored). Required variables:

```text
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=<supabase project url>
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_KEY=<supabase anon/publishable key>
EXPO_PUBLIC_OWM_KEY=<openweathermap api key>
EXPO_PUBLIC_AGENTMAIL_LOGO_URL=<public https url of alert-email logo, e.g. email-assets bucket file>
```

Server-only (set via `supabase secrets set`, never `EXPO_PUBLIC_`):

```text
AGENTMAIL_API_KEY=<agentmail api key>
AGENTMAIL_SENDER_INBOX=<sender inbox, optional>
```

### Placeholder / Inactive Modules

The following remain pending:

- **Additional analytics charts** — battery chart is implemented; other historical energy metrics are future work
- **Notification safety thresholds** — high-load and voltage min/max rules early-return (`null`) until production thresholds are configured
- **Forgot password** — no route or screen exists yet

---

## Data Flow

The intended data flow is:

```text
Physical Sensors (ESP32)
       │
       ▼
   Wi-Fi / HTTP
       │
       ▼
   Supabase
(PostgreSQL + Realtime + Edge Functions + Storage)
       │
       ├──────────────► Admin Dashboard (planned)
       │
       ├── Alert Email (AgentMail via Edge Function)
       │
       ▼ (Realtime postgres_changes)
AdlaWatt Mobile App
       │
       ├── Dashboard
       ├── Notifications
       ├── Activity Logs
       ├── Appliances
       ├── Components
       └── Analytics
```

Users authenticate through Supabase; all queries and real-time channels are scoped to the authenticated user.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Install the following before running the project:

- Node.js
- npm
- Git
- Expo CLI / EAS CLI
- Android Studio for Android development and emulation
- Visual Studio Code or another code editor
- A Supabase project and an OpenWeatherMap API key

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd AdlaWatt
```

### Environment Setup

Create a `.env.local` file in the project root and add the required values:

```bash
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://<your-project>.supabase.co

## Limitations

The current prototype has several limitations.

### Prototype Limitation

The project is currently a prototype and is not intended for commercial production or large-scale deployment.

### Backup Power Only

AdlaWatt is designed as an alternative power source during electricity interruptions. It is not intended to replace the electrical grid.

### Solar Dependence

Energy harvesting depends on available sunlight.

### Compatible Appliances

The system is intended for compatible household appliances within the supported power capacity.

### Internet Connectivity

Real-time mobile monitoring requires network connectivity between the IoT system, cloud services, and mobile application.

### ESP32 / Hardware Integration

The ESP32 hardware feed is being integrated. The application consumes data through Supabase, but the end-to-end hardware → cloud → app loop is not yet fully verified.

### Placeholder Modules

- Additional analytics charts are future work (battery chart is implemented; `AnalyticsChartCard` is reusable for other metrics)
- Appliance recommendations are battery-aware only while live monitoring data is present; without it, the app falls back to a wattage threshold
- Notification safety rules for high load and voltage min/max early-return until production thresholds are configured
- The forgot password screen has no route or implementation yet

### Settings Persistence

Theme, typography (font size/family), and the global email-notification toggle persist across restarts (AsyncStorage + Supabase). Color-blind mode, language, and vibration are session-only by design.

### Dark Mode Coverage

Dashboard screens and shared components follow the active theme via `useAppColors`. Auth screens intentionally remain light (no theme provider there by design).

## Sustainable Development Goals

AdlaWatt supports the following United Nations Sustainable Development Goals:

### SDG 7 — Affordable and Clean Energy

AdlaWatt promotes the use of solar energy as a renewable source of backup electricity.

### SDG 11 — Sustainable Cities and Communities

The system provides households with an alternative source of electricity during power interruptions.

### SDG 13 — Climate Action

The project encourages the use of solar energy and renewable electricity sources.

The capstone specifically identifies SDG 7, SDG 11, and SDG 13 as the primary SDG alignments of the study.

---

## Research Evaluation

The AdlaWatt study uses the **System Usability Scale (SUS)** to evaluate the usability of the mobile application.

The evaluation focuses on users' assessment of:

- Real-time monitoring
- Appliance recommendation
- Overall user experience
- Mobile application usability

The SUS consists of 10 evaluation items and is interpreted using a Likert scale.

The SUS calculation follows:

```text
SUS Score = (Sum of Score Contributions) × 2.5
```

The capstone identifies SUS as the evaluation tool for assessing the usability of the developed mobile application.

---

## Development Approach

The project follows an iterative development process for the hardware and software components.

The development process includes:

1. Requirements Analysis
2. Planning
3. System Design
4. Hardware Development
5. Software Development
6. Unit Testing
7. Integration Testing
8. System Testing
9. Acceptance Testing

The research documentation identifies experimental research as the study design and uses the V-Model development approach for system development and testing.

---

## Research Purpose

AdlaWatt was developed to address the need for a practical and affordable backup power solution during electricity interruptions.

The research identifies a gap in existing systems that commonly provide energy monitoring but do not combine portable off-grid solar harvesting, real-time battery monitoring, temperature monitoring, appliance recommendations, and mobile application monitoring in one system.

The project therefore combines these features into a single system intended to help households monitor and manage available backup energy more safely and efficiently.
